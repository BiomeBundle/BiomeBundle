OverrideParentHeight: false

SmoothRadius: 0

# Moves the smoothing area up or down relative to the BO3 (at the points where the smoothing area is connected to the BO3). Handy when using SmoothStartTop: false and the BO3 has some layers of ground included, in that case we can set the HeightOffset to a negative value to lower the BO3 into the ground and we can set the SmoothHeightOffset to a positive value to move the smoothing area starting height up.
SmoothHeightOffset: 0

# Should the smoothing area be attached at the bottom or the top of the edges of the BO3? Defaults to false (bottom). Using this setting can make things slower so try to avoid using it and use SmoothHeightOffset instead if for instance you have a BO3 with some ground layers included. The only reason you should need to use this setting is if you have a BO3 with edges that have an irregular height (like some hills).
SmoothStartTop: false

BO3Group:

When the server starts the spawn point is determined and the BO3's for the biome it is in are loaded, one of these BO3s that has IsSpawnPoint set to true (if any) is selected randomly and is spawned at the spawn point regardless of its rarity (so even Rarity:0, IsSpawnPoint: true BO3's can get spawned as the spawn point!).

# Branches are child-BO3's that spawn if this BO3 is configured to spawn as a
# CustomStructure resource in a biome config. Branches can have branches,
# making complex structures possible. See the wiki for more details.

# Regular Branches spawn each branch with an independent chance of spawning.
# When IsOTGPlus is set to false: Branch(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][IndividualChance])
# When IsOTGPlus is set to true: Branch(x,y,z,isRequiredBranch,branchName,rotation,chance,branchDepth[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance,branchDepth[,...]][IndividualChance])
# branchName - name of the object to spawn.
# rotation - NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
# IndividualChance - The chance each branch has to spawn, assumed to be 100 when left blank
# isRequiredBranch - If this is set to true then at least one of the branches in this BO3 must spawn at these x,y,z coordinates. If no branch can spawn there then this BO3 fails to spawn and its branch is rolled back.
# isRequiredBranch:true branches must spawn or the current branch is rolled back entirely. This is useful for grouping BO3's that must spawn together, for instance a single room made of multiple BO3's/branches.
# If all parts of the room are connected together via isRequiredBranch:true branches then either the entire room will spawns or no part of it will spawn.
# *Note: When isRequiredBranch:true only one BO3 can be added per Branch() and it will automatically have a rarity of 100.0.
# isRequiredBranch:false branches are used to make optional parts of structures, for instance the middle section of a tunnel that has a beginning, middle and end BO3/branch and can have a variable length by repeating the middle BO3/branch.
# By making the start and end branches isRequiredBranch:true and the middle branch isRequiredbranch:false you can make it so that either:
# A. A tunnel spawns with at least a beginning and end branch
# B. A tunnel spawns with a beginning and end branch and as many middle branches as will fit in the available space.
# C. No tunnel spawns at all because there wasn't enough space to spawn at least a beginning and end branch.
# branchDepth - When creating a chain of branches that contains optional (isRequiredBranch:false) branches branch depth is configured for the first BO3 in the chain to determine the maximum length of the chain.
# branchDepth - 1 is inherited by each isRequiredBranch:false branch in the chain. When branchDepth is zero isRequiredBranch:false branches cannot spawn and the chain ends. In the case of the tunnel this means the last middle branch would be
# rolled back and an IsRequiredBranch:true end branch could be spawned in its place to make sure the tunnel has a proper ending.
# Instead of inheriting branchDepth - 1 from the parent branchDepth can be overridden by child branches if it is set higher than 0 (the default value).
# isRequiredBranch:true branches do inherit branchDepth and pass it on to their own branches, however they cannot be prevented from spawning by it and also don't subtract 1 from branchDepth when inheriting it.

# Weighted Branches spawn branches with a dependent chance of spawning.
# When IsOTGPlus is set to false: WeightedBranch(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][MaxChanceOutOf])
# When IsOTGPlus is set to true: WeightedBranch(x,y,z,isRequiredBranch,branchName,rotation,chance,branchDepth[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance,branchDepth[,...]][MaxChanceOutOf])
# *Note: isRequiredBranch must be set to false. It is not possible to use isRequiredBranch:true with WeightedBranch() since isRequired:true branches must spawn and automatically have a rarity of 100.0.
# MaxChanceOutOf - The chance all branches have to spawn out of, assumed to be 100 when left blank

# spawnChance - For each spawn attempt, the chance between 0-100 that the spawn attempt will succeed.
# maxCount - The maximum amount of this kind of entity that can exist within 32 blocks. If there are already maxCount or more entities of this type in a 32 radius this spawner will not spawn anything.

# OTG has some built in ModData commands for basic mob and block spawning.

# For mob spawning in OTG use: ModData(x,y,z,OTG,mob/MobType/Count/Persistent/Name)
# mob: Makes OTG recognise this as a mob spawning command.
# MobType: Lower-case, no spaces. Any vanilla mob like dragon, skeleton, wither, villager etc
# Count: The number of mobs to spawn
# Persistent (true/false): Should the mobs never de-spawn? If set to true the mob will get a
# name-tag ingame so you can recognise it.
# Name: A name-tag for the monster/npc.
# Example: ModData(0,0,0,OTG,villager/1/true/Bob)
# To spawn blocks using ModData use: ModData(x,y,z,OTG,block/material)
